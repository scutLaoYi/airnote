# AIRNOTE

My online notebook project.

## Base libraries

* a funny mvc framework for php: https://github.com/panique/php-mvc
* a google authenticator class in php: https://github.com/PHPGangsta/GoogleAuthenticator

## Third Party service

* notification for your server's alert: http://tonggao.baidu.com

## Goals for this project

It's useful to have a online notebook on my own.
It's host on a server, it can be access anywhere if you have Internet connection, and the most important thing is that only you can get the infomation store in it.
So that's my goal.

And I can practice my php coding skill since now I have a job about php and web.
